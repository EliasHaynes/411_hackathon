    Possible Solution: Make each page contain up to # of articles. Then divide the total # of articles by that page limit #. Get a sum of total amount of pages that were created. Make each set of 6 be a sector. Accumulate how many times the user clicks the new page icon and have that compared to the sector # of specific sectors so we know which page #'s to show.
